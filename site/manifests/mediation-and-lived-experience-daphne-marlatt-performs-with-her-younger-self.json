There is an interesting overlay, here, of a newer trend in young women’s vocal style onto Marlatt discussing her youth.

One sound, pages rustling overlaps with these changes in the sound quality of the recording. It is likely that the rustling pages are from 2019, but it’s not entirely clear which time they belong to. This indeterminacy suggests that the situatedness of sound media may also be indeterminate. Here, what Trent Wintermeier calls the “unverifiability of listening” in this anthology is also an unverifiability of mediation. We would venture that unverifiable mediation is similar to the \"grain of address and its expressive physiological textures\" that make up social voice, here expanding the concept of voice to the technologies that capture and shape it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Social","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"2019","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"1969","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://AVAnnotate.github.io/voices/mediation_and_lived_experience_daphne_marlatt_performs_with_her_younger_self/canvas/3#t=297,297"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://AVAnnotate.github.io/voices/mediation_and_lived_experience_daphne_marlatt_performs_with_her_younger_self/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"lynne who has been\n\n\n\nshoveling snow\n\n\n\n\nwet hair a cold the\n\n\ncold gleams you wet\n\n\nfortune’s turned\n\n\n\n\nyr card given\n\n\ncrystals reflect you\n\n\nrains enrich\n\n\nyr finger ex\n\n\ntended wants to know\n\n\n\n\nyou type?\n\n\n\n\nshowing you my fingers do\n\n\nwalk their, speak hair caught\n\n\ndropt water barrettes\n\n\nbetter than a million\n\n\nmovies kept\n\n\n\n\nwhen they tore off the\n\n\nroof rain bowed the\n\n\ntractor’s claw dug walls fell\n\n\na pack of cards topt\n\n\nthe whole\n\n\n\n\nhell\n\n\n\n\no face you aren’t\n\n\naccustomed to look at life\n\n\nsavers you\n\n\noffered me lime\n\n\ngreens yr mouth\n\n\n\n\nbird dropt in, linnet\n\n\nhow’s yr new house?\n\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Reading","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcription","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"1969","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://AVAnnotate.github.io/voices/mediation_and_lived_experience_daphne_marlatt_performs_with_her_younger_self/canvas/3#t=297,354"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://AVAnnotate.github.io/voices/mediation_and_lived_experience_daphne_marlatt_performs_with_her_younger_self/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"In Bloomington we were living in Pigeon Hill which was a very poor part of town.

the end of the recording, Marlatt’s vocal delivery has lost much of the self-conscious performativity of the beginning. Even in these moments of situated voice, where she addresses the audience, she is focused on the poems that she sorts through and the decision of what to read. In this moment, we hear the reading voice begin to overtake speaking, situated, and social voice. It may be that Marlatt is more tired, or perhaps more comfortable in front of her audience. But what we hear is also the ways that written poetry, which she holds in her hands, becomes her object of attention. It would be tempting to interpret this shift within a conventional approach to literary audio, given primacy to the pre-existing textual artwork. However, we think instead that we hear the material object of the poem begin to shape Marlatt’s performance and embodiment. There is a compelling resonance, then, with the contrast between object and action that Marlatt sets up near the beginning of the recording. The mediated object of the written poem is shaping the action of reading, not just the sounds that Marlatt articulates, but her situatedness within a room and her relationship to audience.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Situated","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Social","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"2019","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://AVAnnotate.github.io/voices/mediation_and_lived_experience_daphne_marlatt_performs_with_her_younger_self/canvas/3#t=671,671"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://AVAnnotate.github.io/voices/mediation_and_lived_experience_daphne_marlatt_performs_with_her_younger_self/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Okay I’ll just read one.
