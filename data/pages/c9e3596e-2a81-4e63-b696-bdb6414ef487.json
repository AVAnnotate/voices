This recording is held in both the Naropa Archives and the Michael McClure fonds at Simon Frasier University, a SpokenWeb partner. The poems in Ghost Tantras dip in and out of what McClure calls “beast language,” an ecstatic register of leonine nonsense that mimics the guttural growls and roars of large mammals. Beast Language was McClure’s attempt to activate “the biological bases of poetry” (Scratching 43), a practical application of what he dubbed “Meat Science.” “For McClure, humans are meat,” writes Michael Davidson, “and one’s expression—in its ideal state—is an incarnation of one’s mammal nature” (Davidson 87). Rather infamously, McClure read a selection of these poems to the lions at the San Francisco Zoo, an escapade captured in a 1966 episode of the documentary series USA Poetry, developed by poet and Beat associate Richard O. Moore: Ten years later, during a whistle-stop retrospective of Beat history with Ginsberg at Naropa, McClure makes a show of his hesitance to read “Ghost Tantra 49,” one of the very same poems he had triumphantly declaimed to a cage of lions the decade prior."

In the Ghost Tantras, the unprepared passage from English to beastly nonsense and back performs the extreme dissolution of the Cartesian split. And given that beast language so exuberantly infuses body, meat, and muscle with capacities for expression, we have to ask: why should the experience of floating in an isolation tank, which allows one to become free within a few minutes” (Lilly 22), license McClure’s reading in beast language before the Naropa audience in 1976?"

So interiorized is this mode of listening that McClure demurs at any suggestion of materialization. In his essay “A Mammal Gallery,” he describes listening to a tape recording of a snow leopard’s performance—“more beautiful than any composition of Mozart”—and studiously declining to privilege its preservation (156). “The tape is a work of art as we listen. But we have no desire to add it to the universe of media and plastic artifacts. We see, hear, feel through the veil. WE are translated.”"

The isolation tank, in other words, is a foil for that set of difference-making material contexts to which critical readings of the audio archive might attend—and all the more successfully so when equipped with platforms like AudiAnnotate. Because it allows one to layer observations and interpretations across a single time axis, this flexible annotation tool enables close listening to the multiple voices one hears in the audio record."

Attention to the reading voice strives to restore the difference made by the dynamic relationship between the performative voice and the printed page. The situated voice, meanwhile, attunes us to the institutionally mediated relation between the performer and the audience. Finally, listening for the social voice requires tarrying with the grain of address and its expressive physiological textures–the “unique voice that signifies nothing but itself,” in Adriana Cavarero’s phrase–as much as the compacted social histories those textures index (7)."

Grahhr!” as long as we care to listen. At the same time, by bursting the isolation tank of the poetry reading, we can give speech a measure of its body back, the gurglings, drips, rumblings, heart, and pulsebeats. In the process, as listeners at the remove of the present “WE are translated” indeed–into the sonorous language of differences that history makes."
